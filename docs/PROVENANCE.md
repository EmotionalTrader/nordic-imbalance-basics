# PROVENANCE: AI vs. open-source

- **Before 2025-08-20:** some scaffolding/code snippets were LLM-assisted.
- **From 2025-08-20 onward:** new features (A85 ingestion, FI, DAâ†”A85 join/analytics)
  are authored manually using **open-source libraries only** (no LLM code generation).
- **Runtime:** open-source only (requests/entsoe-py, lxml/xmltodict, pandas, matplotlib, etc.);
  **no LLMs at runtime**.
